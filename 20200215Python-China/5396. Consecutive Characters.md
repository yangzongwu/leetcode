### [5396\. Consecutive Characters](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/consecutive-characters/)

Difficulty: **简单**


Given a string `s`, the power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Return _the power_ of the string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "triplepillooooow"
Output: 5
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "hooraaaaaaaaaaay"
Output: 11
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: s = "tourist"
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 500`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def maxPower(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0
        rep=0
        k=0
        while k<len(s):
            cnt=1
            target=s[k]
            i=1
            while k+i<len(s) and s[k+i]==target:
                i+=1
                cnt+=1
            k+=i
            rep=max(rep,cnt)
        rep=max(rep,cnt)
        return rep
```
