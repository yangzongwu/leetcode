### [137\. Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears _three_ times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return sum(nums)-(sum(nums)-sum(set(nums)))*3//2
```
