### [419\. Battleships in a Board](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/)

Difficulty: **中等**

Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with `'X'`s, empty slots are represented with `'.'`s. You may assume the following rules:

*   You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
*   Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1xN` (1 row, N columns) or `Nx1` (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
*   At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.

**Example:**  

```
X..X
...X
...X
```

In the above board there are 2 battleships.

**Invalid Example:**  

```
...X
XXXX
...X
```

This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating between them.

Could you do it in **one-pass**, using only **O(1) extra memory** and **without modifying** the value of the board?


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def countBattleships(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        cnt=0
        for row in range(len(board)):
            for col in range(len(board[0])):
                if board[row][col]=='X':
                    cnt+=1
                    if row-1>=0 and board[row-1][col]=='X':
                        cnt-=1
                    if col-1>=0 and board[row][col-1]=='X':
                        cnt-=1
        return cnt
```
