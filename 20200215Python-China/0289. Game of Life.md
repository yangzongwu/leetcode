### [289\. Game of Life](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/game-of-life/)

Difficulty: **中等**


According to the : "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a _board_ with _m_ by _n_ cells, each cell has an initial state _live_ (1) or _dead_ (0). Each cell interacts with its (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

**Example:**

```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```

**Follow up**:

1.  Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
2.  In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def gameOfLife(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
