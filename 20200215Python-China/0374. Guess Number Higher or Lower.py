'''
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
Example :

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        l,r=0,n
        while l<=r:
            mid=(l+r)//2
            if guess(mid)==0:
                return mid
            elif guess(mid)==1:
                l=mid+1
            else:
                r=mid-1
